    <p>Wednesday Addams is about a girl who suffers from being an "outcast", and gets expelled from her old school because of her vile actions. She moves into this new school, but there are secrets she uncovers along the way about herself and her parent's past. A twisting thriller and mystery, and very entertaining. </p>
    <p>I like this TV Show mainly because it was the only one that I could watch 3 times without getting bored. Normally, I can't even finish a TV Show but this one surprisingly had me hooked and excited the whole time. I also find the main lead actress Jenna Ortega very pretty and good at acting. I also like the fact that it is a mystery/thriller, and I love those genres. The plot twists were very unexpected and kept me on the edge of my seat. I also like the fact that it is a Netflix original series, and I am a sucker for Netflix shows. Overall, I would rate this show a 10/10.</p>
